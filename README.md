BigScreen
=========

A BigScreen display switcher which runs in the browser. Configure URLs to switch between and local image files

Setting up:

You can set this up on unix/linux/mac or Windows with cygwin installed.

Edit settings.sh to define where you installed this project, where your photos are (Dropbox), what browser to use and the screen dimensions.

Then run the make-auto-pics.sh script to scan for your pictures and generate an automatic list of pictures to loop through.
Hopefully you won't have to tweak anything to get this working.
